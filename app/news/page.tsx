      news: "In response to recent discussions stemming from partial school circulars shared online, Kyambogo College School aims to clarify the 2024 term one fees structure.<br><br>Contrary to social media claims, there was no arbitrary fee increase. Over the years, fees in term one have consistently been higher than in the second and third terms due to items paid once a year, such as Uneb registration, PTA Subscription, Students’ attendance swiping card, Calendar, and Magazine.<br><br>It’s essential to note that the only new fee included in the structure for the year 2024 is the Kyambogo College School Platinum celebration of Ug shs 50,000/=, as agreed upon in the Annual General Parent’s meeting to be paid in term one and two 2024.<br><br>Kyambogo College School is a government school with some staff on the government payroll; however, it differs from USE schools – relying on supplementary fees for certain operational costs, meals, and developments.<br><br>We appreciate public feedback and are committed to transparency. For inquiries or additional information, please contact the school administration. We value your understanding and continued support in ensuring each student receives the best possible education at Kyambogo College School.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Mugume Stanley,<br>Headteacher"
